## 📊 Example Usages
- **Truncate a Simple Array**:
    - Input: `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`
    - Shift: `2`
    - Output: `[3, 4, 5]` (the first two elements have been removed)

- **View First Elements**:
    - Input: `[[1, 2], [3, 4], [5, 6]]`
    - Dimension: `0` (to view along rows)
    - Output: `[[1, 2]]` (only the first row is shown)
